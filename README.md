# RAG Chatbot

This RAG chatbot leverages a Flask backend to process user queries by retrieving relevant document chunks from a dataset, generating context-aware responses using a pre-trained BART model. The frontend, built with Next.js and Typescript, interacts with the Flask API to display these responses in a chat interface beautified using TailwindCSS.
